# MagicFileChecker

MagicFileChecker is a tool for bulk comparison of file structure and extensions.

You can use it to check recovered files from broken filesystem, backups, etc.
It uses file extension as first sign and file structure (by default first 1024 bytes) as second.
In most cases they must match (with some exceptions).

You can build the binary for your OS using MagicFileChecker-build script
